# Data-driven Image Viewer for Tableau Dashboards

Don't be stuck just using the web page object to view images from your data. With the image viewer extension you can display many different images all on the same dashboard, and handle multiple image selection.

The image viewer can be customised to fit the colour scheme of your dashboard, as well as display both a toolbar for image rotation, navigation and zoom.
